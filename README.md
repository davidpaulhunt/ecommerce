## Project Ecommerce

First, thank you to Shoppe for inspiring me. Their data structure helped me to better understand what I'm working towards.

### About

This is a project designed to create an open source ecommerce platform. Specifically, a way for users to create and manage a complete store, inventory, and sales system all based on Rails. It is very important to allow for multiple users each having the chance to create multiple, unique stores. Additionally, they should be able to customize the front end of their store.

### Associations

Users create and own stores. Each store has their own products and product categories.

Orders are created which belong to the store. Orders own products through order items.

### Contributing

If you'd like to help, please contact me. Thanks.
